I started getting the hang of this app because I've been seeing this used by cool people and most of the time they use it to make it for personal visual for others. So its such a happy opportunity to join GitHub! I'm looking foward for any collaborations. 
I also probably get to know more about you guys too just by viewing yours. I saw alot of effort people put in their accounts, it tells me who you are and what you're into, lovely and unquie! I love every creativity you guys show And don't take me as a stalker, I'm just a very courious type. :,)
I hope you're having a good day aswell.


***I'm pretty active (depending with holidays/school) on ponytown so If you see me around Just say Hi or give a follow, I'll probrably follow you too. if you have concerns or questions - whisper. . .***

I have no remorse of its denialed completion though. I'll be around and surely enough, I'll finish it till then. Thank you for your patience*! <3
